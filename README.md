This project is about managing attendance. It has been observed that managing presenty and absenty of students from respective subjects/courses can be difficult. As of using papers calculating presenty/absenty % and identifying low % students can be tedious job. Also if student having low attendance can be informed likewisely. This all things can be concluded to this project.
